# Nest Hackathon Starter <a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo_text.svg" height="28px" alt="Nest Logo"/></a>

This project contains boilerplate for creating APIs using [Nest](https://nestjs.com), a progressive [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

It is mostly built to be used as a starting point in hackathons and implements common operations such as sign up, JWT authentication, mail validation, model validation and database access.

## Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/moneebullah25/nest-starter.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` or [directly create your own GitHub repository using this template](https://github.com/moneebullah25/nest-starter/generate).

## 🚀 Features

1. **PostgreSQL with Prisma** – Easy-to-use and scalable relational database integration with auto-generated types.
2. **JWT Authentication** – Secure login and session management using JSON Web Tokens.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 16**
- **NPM or Yarn**
- **PostgreSQL (Local or Docker)**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized development)

---

## 📁 Project Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moneebullah25/nest-starter.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm ci
```

---

## 📦 Environment Configuration

All environment-specific configurations are managed inside the `env/` directory. You should maintain separate `.env` files for each environment:

- `env/dev.env`
- `env/test.env`
- `env/production.env`

These files contain sensitive variables like DB URLs, API keys, mail credentials, and project metadata.

Here is an example of a `env/test.env` file:

```dotenv
NODE_ENV=test

DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_NAME=starter

ADMINER_PORT=8080

PORT=3000

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://${DATABASE_USERNAME}:${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@${DATABASE_HOST}:${DATABASE_PORT}/${DATABASE_NAME}"

JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=86400

SENDGRID_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SENDGRID_PORT=587
SENDGRID_SECURE=false
SENDGRID_USER=apikey
SENDGRID_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key

SENDER_NAME=Your Project Name
SENDER_EMAIL=your@email.com

PROJECT_NAME=Your Project
PROJECT_ADDRESS=123 Nest Street, Pakistan
PROJECT_LOGO_URL=https://yourdomain.com/logo.png
PROJECT_SLOGAN=Made with ❤️ in Pakistan
PROJECT_COLOR=#123456

PROJECT_SOCIAL_GITHUB=https://github.com/your-repo
PROJECT_SOCIAL_1_NAME=Twitter
PROJECT_SOCIAL_1_URL=https://twitter.com/yourhandle
PROJECT_SOCIAL_2_NAME=LinkedIn
PROJECT_SOCIAL_2_URL=https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile

PROJECT_URL=http://localhost:4200
MAIL_VERIFICATION_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/verify
MAIL_CHANGE_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/change-email
RESET_PASSWORD_URL=http://localhost:4200/reset-password
TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4200/legal/terms
```

## ✉️ Mail Configuration (Nodemailer & SendGrid)

This project uses [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) with **SendGrid SMTP** for sending transactional emails (verification, password reset, etc).

A delivery provider is required for sending mails with Nodemailer. I mostly use SendGrid to send mails, however, Nodemailer can work with any service with SMTP transport.

To get a SendGrid API key:

    Create a free account from https://signup.sendgrid.com/
    Confirm your account via the activation email and login.
    Create an API Key with mail sending capability.

Enter your API key and sender credentials to env file. Sender credentials are the sender name and sender mail that will be seen by your users.

```dotenv
SENDGRID_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SENDGRID_PORT=587
SENDGRID_SECURE=false
SENDGRID_USER=apikey
SENDGRID_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDER_NAME=Your Project Name
SENDER_EMAIL=your@email.com
```

> You can obtain your SendGrid API Key by signing up at [https://sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com) and creating an API key with email send permissions.

All email credentials and sender configurations are loaded dynamically via `config.ts` using the current environment file.

---

## 📬 Mail Template Configurations

The mail templates are dynamically populated using values defined in your environment file. These values include:

- Project name, address, logo, slogan, and brand color
- Social media URLs
- Important URLs for actions like email verification, password reset, etc.

Mail templates are highly customizable and heavily depend on configurations. Enter your project's information to env file. Urls are used as references in the templates. If your mail verification logic is independent from your front-end application, you can use API's own mail verification endpoint, e.g. http://localhost:3000/auth/verify, as mailVerificationUrl. Otherwise, send a HTTP GET request to verification endpoint with token added as a parameter named token, e.g, http://localhost:3000/auth/verify?token=**VERIFICATION_TOKEN**

Example:

```env
PROJECT_NAME=Your Project
PROJECT_ADDRESS=123 Nest Street, Pakistan
PROJECT_LOGO_URL=https://yourdomain.com/logo.png
PROJECT_SLOGAN=Made with ❤️ in Pakistan
PROJECT_COLOR=#123456
PROJECT_SOCIAL_GITHUB=https://github.com/your-repo
```

> The backend handles generating tokenized verification links like `/auth/verify?token=xyz`.

## 📄 Swagger API Docs

Swagger UI is available at `/api` when you run the server. It displays all available routes, DTOs, and expected request/response formats.

---

## 🗃 Database & Prisma

This project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM for PostgreSQL. Prisma makes it easy to manage and migrate your schema.

After setting your `DATABASE_URL` in the env file, you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate         # Generate Prisma client
npm run migrate:dev           # Apply dev migrations
npm run prisma:studio           # Open Prisma web GUI
```

Use `seed.ts` files for seeding test data.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and run inside the `test/` directory.

### Run tests:

```bash
npm run test            # Runs all unit tests
npm run test:watch      # Watches and reruns tests
npm run test:e2e        # End-to-end tests using Jest & Supertest
```

> Uses `env/test.env` during tests for isolation.

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

Run your API and PostgreSQL using Docker for clean environment management.

### Build and Start Containers

```bash
npm run docker:dev             # Start using env/dev.env
npm run docker:test              # Start with test environment
npm run docker:production        # Start production environment
```

You can also run database or Adminer container only:

```bash
npm run docker:db:dev
npm run docker:adminer:dev
npm run docker:db:test
npm run docker:adminer:test
npm run docker:db:production
npm run docker:adminer:production
```

Stop them with:

```bash
npm run docker:db:stop
npm run docker:adminer:stop
```
